# About

Hi, welcome to my small website!  
My name is Darius Jonda and I currently work, live and study in Berlin, the beautiful *(well at least sometimes)* capital of Germany.

Even though I don't have the typical educational background in computer science *(I actually studied economics at the hu-berlin)*, I really enjoy programming, especially in Haskell and R.  
I'm self employed since the beginning of 2015 and do various data analysis tasks like creating reproducible reports and interactive data dashboards for a living.  

 Specifically [Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/), a web-framework for the [R](https://www.r-project.org) programming language developed by [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) is one of the main tools I'm working with since around two years. If your company is looking for new ways to represent various data sources, you should definitely inspect this framework.  
If you are interested in any of that stuff or need some assistance, feel free to [contact me](contact.html).  

Apart from data munging and programming I love travelling, going to the gym and playing videogames, whenever there is too much free time *(especially Starcraft 2 where I'll probably kick ur butt... ;) )*.
