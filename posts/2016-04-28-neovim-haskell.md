Well after lurking around some additional ressources to set up [Neovim](https://neovim.io) as a proper Haskell IDE I was unfortunately quite underwhelmed that there were not that many to find... that's why I decided to write about my current setup.  

Why Neovim?
-----------

First of all: I am a vim fanboy and there is nothing I can do about it. The fact, that I really like the built in terminal, async plugin updating and other nice features, I've decided to go with neovim instead of vim as my main text editor.  
Packages and settings are of course identical, so there was no real sacrifice in the switch.
